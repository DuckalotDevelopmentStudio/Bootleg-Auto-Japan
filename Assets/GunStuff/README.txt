To create a new gun:
	Drag model under camera.
	Add a gun controller on the model.
	Add scope on the model.
	Add a scope camera - then add that scope camera to the array on the main camera *
	Add an emmision chamber, this is where the bullets will come out.

* Full support not added yet for now set this to be the first in array and disable the other gun.
